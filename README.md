In this homework you will configure an AWS Cloud9 programming environment supporting programming languages of Java, C/C++, Python and others. Multiple languages will be used as we detect and mitigate software errors. Becoming comfortable with your programming environment will set the foundation for the rest of the assignments.

<h1>Assignment</h1>

To successfully complete this assignment (and this course), you will need to configure your environment for testing multiple languages. Follow the documentation available in the AWS Cloud Resources content area, be sure you have successfully created an AWS Education Starter account and started your Cloud0 environment.

Once you have completed configuring your AWS and Cloud9 accounts, use Cloud9 to create your own <strong>unique</strong> Hello, World application Java, Python and the C++ programming language. Be sure your code runs properly within the Cloud9 environment.

Note, by unique, you should specifically place at least 4 additional lines of code beyond the Hello, World output. I leave it up to you to make a special greeting message, a timestamp, or some other special signature output that you create.

<h1>Deliverables</h1>

Provide your Hello, World source files for each language (Java, Python and C++).  Discuss the steps you had to perform to get the source code running within the Cloud9 environment. You should also provide well-organized and labeled screen shots in a word or PDF file documenting the successful running of each of your Hello, World Applications. Note: Be sure to provide all screen shots in one word of PDF document. You can compress the files using a zip application for easier upload.
